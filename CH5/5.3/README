This example was tested against SOAP4R 1.5.8, to install:

  gem install soap4r

If you don't have Rails installed, you'll need to install ActiveRecord:

  gem install activerecord

The default configuration uses an SQLite3 database, you may have to install the
gem separately:

  gem install sqlite3-ruby 

You can use a different database server by changing the database.yaml
configuration file.

Start the server first:

  ruby server.rb

Next, run the test client:

  ruby client.rb

The client will send a request to the server to generate a new task and return
the new task's identifier.  To stop the server just click Ctrl-C.
