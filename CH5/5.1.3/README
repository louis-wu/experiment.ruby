This example requires Mongrel and RubyZip, if not already installed:

  gem install mongrel
  gem install rubyzip

To start the server, point it to a directory holding the relevant log files:

  ruby log_service.rb /var/logs

To download the latest collection of logs, open your browser to

  http://localhost:3000/logs/last

The server collects log files with the names like errors-2008-06-25.log, where
2008-06-25 is today's date.  If it can't find suitable files you will download
an empty Zip.
