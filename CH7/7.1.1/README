This example uses the Stomp library.  If not already installed:

  gem install stomp

It can use any messaging server that supports Stomp, for example, ActiveMQ.  If
you do not have an existing messaging server, you can use stompserver to try
this example out:

  gem install stompserver
  stompserver

And from a different console:

  ruby example.rb

This example loads error_reporter.rb and uses it to queue an error message.  It
then loads error_consumer.rb, which consumes and prints all messages from the
queue /queue/errors.  To stop the consumer, click Ctrl-C.
