This example illustrates how to process messages from WebSphere MQ and create
new records in the database.  You will need RubyWMQ and ActiveRecord, if not
already installed:

  gem install activerecord
  gem install rubywmq

The WebSphere MQ configuration is located in the file config/wmq.yml.

To run against the database you will need to create a table called leads with
the columns first_name, last_name, company, email and lead_source, and edit
the configuration file config/database.yml.

To run against SalesForce, you need the Active Sales Force gem installed:

  gem install activesalesforce

Copy the configuration in config/salesforce.yml over to config/database.yml and
set your SalesForce user name, password and account URL.
