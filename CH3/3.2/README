These two examples show application scripting using OLE (Windows with Outlook)
and OSA (OS X with iCal).

If you're running Ruby on Windows and using Outlook you can run the code:

  ruby outlook-tasks.rb

The OLE libraries required to use Outlook are part of the standard library for
Ruby on Windows.

If you're running Ruby on OS X, you must first install the Appscript library:

  sudo gem install rb-appscript

Make sure iCal has a calendar called 'Work', new todos are added there.
Run the example using:

  ruby ical-todos.rb

If you're using Growl, you can add the content of growl.rb to the end of
ical-todos.rb and run that script again.  You will see a Growl notification
once all todos are added to your iCal calendar.

The sample.rb file contains one TODO and one FIXME comments.  After running
the script, these should show as oeither Outlook tasks or iCal todos.
