This directory provides source code for the listings in chapter 6 section 1.

These listings are simple examples for how you could process email messages in
your own application.  They are written against a fictitious email server,
using fictitious email accounts, so you will have to change the listing to
the actual email accounts/servers you are using.

Listing 6.2 requires MailFactory, if not already installed:

  gem install mailfactory

Listing 6.5 requires TMail, if not already installed:

  gem install tmail
