This directory provides source code for the listings in chapter 6 section 2.

These listings are simple examples for how you could use instant messaging in
your own application.  They are written against a fictitious IM server using
fictitious IM accounts, so you will have to change the listing to the actual IM
accounts/servers you are using.

Listings 6.6/7 requires Net::Toc, if not already installed:

  gem install net-toc

Listing 6.8/9 requires XMPP4R-Simple, if not already installed:

  gem install xmpp4r-simple
