This example shows the changes you would make to an existing Rails application
to add semi-private personalized feeds.  It adds authentication for feeds
(Atom and RSS) using a private token passed in the request's query parameters.

* app/models/user.rb shows a method and filter you can add to existing user
  model to generate a secure token for each user account.
  
* db/migrate/add_user_token.rb migration adds the token field to the users
  table and creates a token for all existing user accounts.
  
* app/controllers/application.rb adds the login_or_feed_token_required filter
  which you can use to authenticate feed access (Atom or RSS).
  
* app/controllers/comments_controller.rb shows how to use the
  login_or_feed_token_required filter to access a feed.
