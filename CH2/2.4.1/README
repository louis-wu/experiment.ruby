This example illustrates two ways to test the ps command (available on OS X, Linux, Cygwin and other UNIX environments).

To run the process checker test with the ps command (may return different result on each run):

  ruby ps_checker_test.rb 

To run the process checker test with fixture (dry run):

  ruby ps_checker_with_fixture.rb
