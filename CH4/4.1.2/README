This directory shows how to use validates_url as a library file.  To get
started, copy lib/validates_url.rb into your Rails application's lib/
directory.

ValidatesUrl
============

Adds URL validation for your ActiveRecord models.  For example:

  class NewsItem < ActiveRecord::Base

    validates_url

  end
  
Without an argument, validates the attribute 'url'.  To validate a different
attribute, pass its name as argument, for example:

  validate_url :profile_url
